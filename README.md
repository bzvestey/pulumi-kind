# Kind Resource Provider

The Kind Resource Provider lets you manage [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) resources.

This wraps [tehcyx/kind](https://github.com/tehcyx/terraform-provider-kind) Terraform Provider.

**NOTE:** This provider is not in a stable state, and I am only just playing around with it in go to try it out.
